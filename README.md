## Process

### Commit 1: Initial Commit
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: Base Files
Added some basic files

### Commit 3: Install Packages
Installed needed packages

### Commit 4: Set-up
I added the required packages to the script and set up the database connection. I also created the file for the database. To protect my password, I have it being pulled from a json in my homework folder. Hopefully this works to protect it!

### Commit 5: Connection
I can now connect to my database. This confirms that my password file is working too!

### Commit 6: Department
Department table is now set up! I checked it in my workbench to make sure everything looked right too! 

### Commit 7: Role
Role table is now set up! I checked it in my workbench to make sure everything looked right too! 

### Commit 8: Employee
Employee table is now also set up. I think next I'll make a seed file to help with the process moving forward.

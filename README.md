## Process

### Commit 1: Initial Commit
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: Base Files
Added some basic files

### Commit 3: Install Packages
Installed needed packages

### Commit 4: Set-up
I added the required packages to the script and set up the database connection. I also created the file for the database. To protect my password, I have it being pulled from a json in my homework folder. Hopefully this works to protect it!
